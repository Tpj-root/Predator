1. **Basic math (must)**

   * Algebra
   * Graphs
   * Simple trigonometry
     (No calculus first)

2. **Concept physics**

   * Motion, time, speed
   * Waves, light
   * Energy
     *(ideas only, no formulas)*

3. **Pre-Einstein ideas**

   * Newton’s motion
   * Galileo relativity
     (frames of reference)

4. **Then Einstein**

   * Thought experiments (train, light clock)
   * Special relativity concepts
   * Only later: formulas

**Good rule:**
👉 *Understand ideas first, math later.*




**Week 1 – Thinking like physics**

* What is time, distance, speed
* Everyday motion examples
* Units (seconds, meters)

**Week 2 – Light & waves**

* What light is
* Speed of light idea
* Why light is special

**Week 3 – Relativity before Einstein**

* Galileo relativity
* Moving frames (bus, train examples)

**Week 4 – Einstein’s ideas**

* No absolute time
* Light speed same for all
* Time dilation (concept only)

**Week 5 – Weird effects**

* Length contraction
* Twin paradox (story style)

**Week 6 – Very light math**

* Simple formulas (no calculus)
* (E = mc^2) meaning
* Real-world uses (GPS)
