The Predator **doesn’t capture Dutch (Arnold) to kill him immediately** because of its **hunter’s code**.


**Why:**

* Predators hunt **for honor, not just killing**.
* They prefer **strong, armed opponents**.
* Dutch becomes **unarmed** after losing his weapons → not an honorable kill.
* The Predator uses the **wrist blade to test him**, not to execute.
* It wants a **fair final hunt**, not an easy kill.

**Key moment:**
When Dutch drops the gun, the Predator **stops using advanced weapons** and fights **hand-to-hand**. That shows respect.

**Blade but not kill:**

* The blade strike is **controlled**.
* It’s checking Dutch’s strength and courage.
* Predator wants him to **fight back fully**.

**Simple idea:**

> No weapon = no honor = no instant kill.
